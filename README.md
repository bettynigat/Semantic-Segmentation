# Semantic-segmentation
[Semantic segmentation](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/semantic-segmentation/) is a type of image segmentation in which we assign labels to every pixel based on type
of the object

###Goal
In this project, we are going to design a convolutional neural network that can segment photographic images as
exemplified below. Specifically, our network will take an image as the input and assign labels to each pixel.
The goal is to achieve as high as possible mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) on the test dataset.
